    "Python allows for [modular programming][1], whereby large program tasks consisting of thousands of lines of code are broken into smaller manageable *modules* of code to allow for easier programming. These modules usually contain code that is [logically similar to each other][2]. Thus, modules are in essence merely files containing Python definitions (coding scripts) with a `.py` suffix [(Python documentation)][3]. The use of modules in this way has [several benefits][4]:\n",
    "* Easier to debug segments of code rather than long scripts\n",
    "* Shorter code segments increases readability and reliability\n",
    "* Allows for the reuse of code segments, speeding up programming\n",

    "As the number of modules for a particular script increase, it becomes unwieldy to manage, and can lead to [collisions between module names][1]. This can cause issues with program execution. It is for this reason that Python allows the grouping of modules of similar content and purpose into a hierarchical structure, called [*packages*][2]. A package can then be considered as a collection of modules. ![pkg][3]Unlike modules, however, a package does not take a `.py` suffix, and needs to include an `__init__.py` file to differentiate it from an otherwise normal [hierarchical directory of files][4]. \n",
